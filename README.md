an 'evolution simulator'. Original code from year 2000 using MFC


## Synopsis

Implements a very simple RISC assembly code that moves 'creatures' around a 2D grid. The 'genome' of each creature is a block of memory that is interpreted as assmenly code. All creatures in the 'world' get one instruction execution per cycle. Successful creatures can beget 'children' and a mutation algorithm copies the code from parent to child.

Back in 2001 I found quite interesting survival behaviour emerging from multiple runs of the 'world'.

I also found that resurrecting the code in 2011 was fun due to the improvement in hardware!

Uploading to github in 2023 for further development ...
